# NADEX-Scraper-Portfolio-Replication
This repository contains code that can be used to extract market data on NADEX traded options, process PDF files into a machine-readable format, and conduct a basic replication using CBOE call options to identify arbitrage opportunities.

Nadex, formerly known as HedgeStreet, is a US-based retail-focused online binary options exchange. It offers retail trading of binary options and spreads on the most heavily traded forex, commodities and stock indices markets. Unlike many trading platforms, NADEX is relatively transparent with traded volumes and pricing, and daily summaries of trade data are available from their website: https://www.nadex.com/market-data/

As an example, the snapshot below shows binary options on foreign exchange. 




Data of this form can have a wide range of applications. Retail traders can examine historical spreads to develop strategies, regulators can assess market efficiency and researchers can study trader behavior and market microstructure.
